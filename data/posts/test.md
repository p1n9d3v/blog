# Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning teach for data that exist answer. if teach input x and answer y(label) to model,also solve the problem that did not learn.

## Classification

Classification is the process of classifying given data according to a set of categories(label). Classification has two classification problem.

-   Binary Classification : True or False
-   Muticalss Classification : classify two or more

## Regression

> In statistics, columns are called features.

## Label

Label is value that sample data is belonging to class or range, for example, the classification for email has two type labels that is spam mail or is not spam mail.

# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised is how to predict result that cluster similar features about new data.

## Clustering

Clustering is the process of dividing data into groups based on similarities between the data, for example, the classification of documents based on subjects divide the data into groups of similar subjects such as Sports, Economics, Politics.

# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforce Learning has no answer, It finds method to get higher reward through own behaviour.
